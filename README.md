# Change-webpages-background
A grease monkey script to change webpages' background.

### Description
Change webpages' background to the picture you choose. Press F2 to change the picture, F4 to switch whether the background displays.

### Known Problems
* Because of github's security policy, the background can't display on github.
* The mobile version of sina weibo pages can't display normally on Chrome(bug?) when the background displays. You can press F4 to hide the background or use other explorer such as Firefox or Edge.
